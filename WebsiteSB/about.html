                <p>Viewers on Twitch are becoming increasingly frustrated with the company's inundation of disruptive ads, which abruptly interrupt their viewing experience. Consequently, they're seeking solutions like ad blockers, inadvertently impacting streamers' income, as ad revenue makes up a big part of the streamers finances. In return this forces streamers to output even more ads, further disturbing the experience of even their most adamant supporters.</p>
